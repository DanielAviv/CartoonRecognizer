### How to train your own detector
In this section I will show how to train an object cascade detector using OpenCV applications.

First of all you will need A LOT of images of the object you are looking for, the more the merrier. For a solid and unchanging object like a logo few will suffice, but if you are looking for faces, you'll need hundreds or even thousands examples.
Apart from that you will need images of negative examples that will be used as background for the training. The negative images can be anything and everything that does NOT contain the object you are looking for.

There is really no "good" number of images for the positive or the negative. You'll just have to get to the number by experience.

Once you have all the images you want you will need two files:
1. The positive file: This file is a ´´´.info´´´ file.
